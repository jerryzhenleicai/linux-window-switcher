For Linux and other X Window System based desktop OS, this Python script allows you to switch any given window through a keyboard shortcut, which is in most cases fasters than mouse clicking or Alt-Tab.


### INSTALL:

Just save this file somewhere on your disk.

### Run it:

To switch to the Chrome brower  or Emacs for examples, run

``` 
python window_switch.py chrome
```bash

``` 
python window_switch.py emacs
```bash

You can find hot key shortcuts to these commands (Gnome for example), so Ctl-Alt-G will switch to Chrome.
